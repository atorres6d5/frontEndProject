A web page that will collect and orginize data from the workorder and the parts made during employees shift.

on the landing page, we add all the travel information from the workorder, the job number, parts to make, employee id number, and the measurements that need to be documented
once the travel information from the workorder is submitted then the second page loads up with all or our submitted information orginized in our header. Also all of our dementions and tolerances are there so we know what to check.
there are input boxes on the bottom of the page with a submit button, on a submit of data a new row on our table is made and our data is input hard into our table and our part count goes up by 1
